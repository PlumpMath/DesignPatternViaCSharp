<case:judgmentbody>
<p>
<text>This is an application by the defendant-appellant for a stay of proceedings, the stay to be made conditionally upon a lesser sum than that fixed by the trial judge. The verdict awarded was for $256,795, there being no dispute about liability. The learned judge made the stay conditionally upon $100,000 being paid into court. Although some considerable time has gone by, that term has not been complied with, and the defendant-appellant at this stage seeks to have the sum reduced to $60,000.</text></p>
<p>
<text>It appears that no submissions were made to the learned judge as to what principles ought to be applied, or what considerations should be applied with regard to the fixing of that amount. The appropriate time to debate these matters is before the trial judge, and to put in full any relevant submissions, particularly as he is in a position of advantage, being fully aware of all the matters relevant to the hearing.</text></p>
<p>
<text>Before us, only the barest of affidavit evidence was provided, reliance being placed on submissions by counsel in relation to the judgment. An adjournment was then sought after the matter had been fully debated and the Bench had indicated a view based upon the judgment. No point would be served by adjourning this matter for the purpose now of putting on a further affidavit, the only purpose of which now would be to clearly put before us the attack which was to be made on the judgment but which has already been put to us in debate. Having considered this judgment, I am of the view that no ground has been made for this court to vary the sum fixed by the learned trial judge.</text></p>
<p>
<text>I would therefore propose that the application be dismissed with costs.</text></p></case:judgmentbody></case:judgment><case:judgment><case:courtinfo><case:judges><case:judge>Hutley JA</case:judge></case:judges></case:courtinfo>
<case:judgmentbody>
<p>
<text>I agree. I would merely emphasize that in my opinion, when a solicitor or counsel is sent to take judgment and apply for a stay, that is not a purely nominal application. Whoever goes to court has to be prepared to make proper submissions on any matters which a judge may wish to lay down as a condition of the stay. If then he lays down terms which are contrary to principle, or unfair, the appellate court is in a proper position to reassess the matter. That was not done in this case.</text></p></case:judgmentbody></case:judgment><case:judgment><case:courtinfo><case:judges><case:judge>Mahoney JA</case:judge></case:judges></case:courtinfo>
<case:judgmentbody>
<p>
<text>The granting of a stay is, of course, an essentially discretionary matter; and a party coming into this court to complain concerning a stay must establish that the discretion was wrongly exercised. On the material that is before this court, I cannot see that onus has been discharged. No doubt, if, as the applicant suggests, there should eventually be a verdict which is less than $100,000 the balance will have to be recovered. There is nothing to suggest that will cause difficulty or that there will be any balance.</text></p>
<p>
<text>In those circumstances, I agree with the orders proposed.</text></p></case:judgmentbody></case:judgment>
