<case:judgmentbody>
<p>
<text>In this matter I published my reasons on 7 March 1980, in which I indicated that upon being satisfied of certain matters, I was prepared to make an order appointing myself as a Special Examiner for the purpose of taking the evidence of Captain Han in Paris in the Republic of France.</text></p>
<p>
<text>I have now been informed by the Chief Justice that the Attorney-General of New South Wales has approved my going to France for the purpose of taking the evidence. The Attorney-General further indicated that it is expected that the Australian Embassy in Paris will be able to provide accommodation and other appropriate facilities for the conduct of the examination. Arrangements have been made by the solicitor for the plaintiff for the provision of the air fare, and as I understand it, the solicitor for the plaintiff is also prepared to make the necessary arrangements with the Attorney-General's Department for the payment of hotel and other expenses in Paris. Finally, I understand that no objection is made by the Republic of France to my administering an oath to the witness.</text></p>
<p>
<text>The provisions of Pt 27, whilst they contemplate a situation in which a judge of the court is the Special Examiner, contain provisions which are inappropriate to cater for such a circumstance. Accordingly it is necessary that I should make certain special orders. I make the following orders:</text></p>
<p>
<text>(1) That Captain Han Ming Li and such further witness or witnesses as the examiner may see fit to examine be examined <emph typestyle="it">viva voce</emph> on oath or affirmation before the Honourable Andrew John Rogers, not in his capacity as a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, but as a Special Examiner appointed by the court for the purpose.</text></p>
<p>
<text>(2) That the examination be held at the Australian Embassy at Paris in the Republic of France commencing on Tuesday 29 April 1980 or such other place as the examiner may deem necessary to appoint.</text></p>
<p>
<text>(3) That the examination be confined to matters relevant to the hearing of the issues in this action in all respects as though the witness or witnesses were examined in court in Sydney upon the hearing of the action.</text></p>
<p>
<text>(4) That the plaintiff be at liberty to examine and re-examine and the defendant be at liberty to cross-examine the witness or witnesses.</text></p>
<p>
<text>(5) That the examiner shall allow or disallow questions and accept or refuse to accept answers or parts of answers, and generally conduct the examination of the witness or witnesses according to law and procedure applicable in the Supreme Court of New South Wales for hearing of Commercial Causes.</text></p>
<p>
<text>(6) That all questions asked and all answers taken shall be reduced into writing and shall be filed in the office of the Prothonotary of this court, and that the same may be read and given in evidence on the hearing of the action, saving all just exceptions.</text></p>
<p>
<text>(7) That the trial judge, being the same person as the examiner, may use his own observations of the demeanour of the witness or witnesses examined pursuant to this order, and generally decide all questions of credibility as though such witness or witnesses had given evidence at the hearing of the action.</text></p>
<p>
<text>(8) The costs and expenses of the examination, including the expenses of the examiner and the preparation and copying of the transcript, shall be costs in the cause.</text></p>
<glp:note>
<h>Editor's Note:</h>
<p>
<text>Subscribers should realise that after this decision Pt 27 was amended to deal specifically with the case where the Judge or the Master was himself the Examiner. A form or order is also set out in <ci:cite searchtype="CASE-REF"><ci:case><ci:caseref ID="cr000135" spanref="cr000135-001"><ci:reporter value="urj"/><ci:refnum num="BC8701032"/></ci:caseref></ci:case><ci:content><citefragment searchtype="CASE-NAME-REF"><emph typestyle="it">Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz (No 6)</emph></citefragment><citefragment searchtype="CASE-CITE-REF"> <ci:span spanid="cr000135-001"> (NSWSC, McLelland J, 28 October 1987, unreported, BC8701032</ci:span></citefragment></ci:content></ci:cite>); but see Pt 36 r 6(6) which now makes an order in the same words unnecessary.</text></p></glp:note></case:judgmentbody></case:judgment>
